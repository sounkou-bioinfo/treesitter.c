Description: Provides bindings to a 'C' grammar for Tree-sitter, to be used
    alongside the 'treesitter' package. Tree-sitter builds concrete syntax trees
    for source files and can efficiently update them or generate code like producing 
    R C API wrappers from C functions, structs and global definitions from header files.
